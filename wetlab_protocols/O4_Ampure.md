# Optional Protocol 4 - Ampure XP amplicon clean up

## Theory
If significant primer dimer formation has occured, these will be quantified by the picogreen assay and lead to poor normalization. If >=25 cycles of PCR have been run during primary PCR, or if during QC, significant primer dimers are observed then this protocol is recommended. Depending on the ratio of beads to DNA volume, a size selection is possible which will remove small DNA. This protocol is set up to use a 1.8x volume; however, this can be adjusted in the script. The defaults in the script will assume you have 50ul amplicon to clean up and will use 90ul beads (1.8x).

## Automated Method

### Materials
- [ ] Ampure XP clean up beads (A63881) *Note: these can be made from scratch for significantly cheaper but may have less consistent size-selection properties*
- [ ] [Opentrons OT2](https://opentrons.com/ot-2)
- [ ] [Opentrons 8-channel 300ul pipette head mounted on right (gen2)](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/ot-2-robot/products/8-channel-electronic-pipette)
- [ ] [Opentrons Magnetic Capture Module (Gen2)](https://opentrons.com/modules/magnetic-module/)
- [ ] 4 x [Opentrons filter 200ul tips](https://shop.opentrons.com/collections/opentrons-tips/products/opentrons-200ul-filter-tips)
- [ ] 1 x Nest 12 Well Reservoir 15 mL (Nest 360112) 
- [ ] 1 x Nest 1 Well Reservoir 195 mL (Nest 360113) **OR** use an empty tip box lid
- [ ] 100% Ethanol
- [ ] Nuclease Free Water
- [ ] Bio-Rad 96 Well Plate 200 µL skirted PCR plate  (Biorad hsp9601) 

### Protocol
- [ ] Prepare fresh 70% ethanol and put in columns 2 and 3 of the 12 well reservoir.
- [ ] Add appropriate volume of beads to well 1 and ensure they are well mixed (bead volume/sample * Nsamples * 1.2)
- [ ] Add appropriate volume of water to well 4 (elution volume * Nsamples * 1.2)
- [ ] Set up OT2 according to Figure 1 below.
- [ ] Obtain a copy of scripts/O4_AmpureXPWash.py
- [ ] Modify lines 15-28 as required with close attention to desired bead volumes and elution volumes.
- [ ] Calibrate all deck positions and run method. **Estimated run time X min**
- [ ] After execution dispose of waste and clean out tip container
